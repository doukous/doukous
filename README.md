# Hello world :wave:

My name is Mohamed Doucouré. I am a software engineer mainly focused on backend development, with experience in web scraping and data extraction.

I mostly work on scrapers, APIs, and data-processing backends.

I am exploring AI topics, particularly Edge AI and AI for healthcare, and I have an interest in mobile app development with React Native.
